            <p>When I started as a programmer I was in a very difficult place personally, and it made it really challenging to suck at being a programmer. Even though I had no talent whatsoever, I was full of <strong><i>survival motivation</i></strong>, which made it possible for me to get what I wanted. Now it‚Äôs different.</p>,
            <p>I though I learned to learn at that time, I kind of did, but I can‚Äôt apply <strong><i>survival motivation</i></strong> to everything hahaha, or I can üòè. It‚Äôs fun to use futuristic scenarios where I save the world with my superpowers to get motivation (not that I really believe that, of course), but the real answer for me is patience and coffee . . . and remembering the reason why I started doing things.</p>

            <p>When I was a little girl, I was afraid of everything, literally. I was afraid of my own shadow and the twilight (not the movie, the real one hahaha), so I know my little me would be surprised and terrified if I told her about my language interests, because, yeah . . . I was afraid of how Russian people sound in movies.</p>,
            <p>Learning a new language is an adventure, you have to be willing to get into a new world of possibilities and problems. Learning English was easy in some ways, it really is everywhere now, and it‚Äôs very difficult to escape from it. </p>,
            <p>When I got into Russian, it was a very random decision, I didn‚Äôt plan to learn it, but I had a little unconscious story with it since 2018, when I found the song that would change everything when stalking a collegue xD <strong><i>(Sudno)</i></strong>, then youtube conspired (spied on me) and showed me a new song, then I got to know a Russian girl, then more music came into the picture and finally . . . the Ukranian war.</p>,
            <p>All these events pushed me to learn Russian. I really got curious about that big chunk of the world full of countries that nobody likes to talk about, and to my surprised, it was totally  worth it.</p>,
            <p><strong>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt underestimate <i>the little things</i>, they can trigger big changes in your life.‚Äù</strong></p>,

            <p>I‚Äôm a person that has a very strong obsessive compultion, which has led me to limit the things I let myself be obsessed about.</p>,
            <p>The first time I did let myself fall hard into an obsession was in 2016, I had so much free time that I decided it didn‚Äôt mattered, luckily I found out that when I‚Äôm in the middle of my obsession, my brain doesn‚Äôt feel how tired I‚Äôm of hearing someone talking in a language I don‚Äôt understand, that‚Äôs how I learned how to watch movies in English without subtitles, it felt like my head was cut open and things just started to make sense.</p>,
            <p>I heard about <strong style={{ fontSize: '18px' }}>–∫–∏—Å-–∫–∏—Å</strong> almost a year ago, I was looking for new music on spotify and the software recommended me one of their tracks, it was amazing, in a weird way, I was not used to the sound they had, the combination was interesting, some kind of electronic sound, plus 2007 emo nostalgia. Months later, after getting into a Russian course, I was looking for an obsession, and rediscovered them by watching their music videos.</p>,
            <p>Whoever had the idea of the artistic concept of this band is a genius. The sound, the designs, the band name, the outfits, the way they approach concerts, the TaTu style of the interactions of the female bandmates, the subtle gopnik style, the music video shots, the colorization, the edition . . . just perfection.</p>,
            <p>Sorry, I got carried away üòÇ, anyways, you get it, now I have hundreds of articles to read  and thousands of videos to watch and I‚Äôm not even mad. </p>,
