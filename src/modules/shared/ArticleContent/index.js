            <p>When I started as a programmer I was in a very difficult place personally, and it made it really challenging to suck at being a programmer. Even though I had no talent whatsoever, I was full of <strong><i>survival motivation</i></strong>, which made it possible for me to get what I wanted. Now it‚Äôs different.</p>,
            <p>I though I learned to learn at that time, I kind of did, but I can‚Äôt apply <strong><i>survival motivation</i></strong> to everything hahaha, or I can üòè. It‚Äôs fun to use futuristic scenarios where I save the world with my superpowers to get motivation (not that I really believe that, of course), but the real answer for me is patience and coffee . . . and remembering the reason why I started doing things.</p>

            <p>When I was a little girl, I was afraid of everything, literally. I was afraid of my own shadow and the twilight (not the movie, the real one hahaha), so I know my little me would be surprised and terrified if I told her about my language interests.</p>,
            <p>Learning a new language is an adventure, you have to be willing to get into a new world of possibilities and problems. Learning English was easy in some ways, it really is everywhere now, and it‚Äôs very difficult to escape from it. </p>,
            <p>When I got into Russian, it was a very random decision, I didn‚Äôt plan to learn it, but I had a little unconscious story with it since 2018, when I found the song that would change everything when stalking a collegue xD <strong><i>(Sudno)</i></strong>, then youtube conspired (spied on me) and showed me a new song, then I got to know a Russian girl, then more music came into the picture and finally . . . the war.</p>,
            <p>I really got curious about that big chunk of the world full of countries that nobody likes to talk about, and to my surprised, it was worth it.</p>,
            <p><strong>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt underestimate <i>the little things</i>‚Äù</strong></p>
