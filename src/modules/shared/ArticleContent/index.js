            <p>When I was a little girl, I was afraid of everything, literally. I was afraid of my own shadow and the twilight (not the movie, the real one hahaha), so I know my little me would be surprised and terrified if I told her about my language interests, because, yeah . . . I was afraid of how Russian people sound in movies.</p>,
            <p>Learning a new language is an adventure, you have to be willing to get into a new world of possibilities and problems. Learning English was easy in some ways, it really is everywhere now, and it‚Äôs very difficult to escape from it. </p>,
            <p>When I got into Russian, it was a very random decision, I didn‚Äôt plan to learn it, but I had a little unconscious story with it since 2018, when I found the song that would change my life forever <strong><i>(too dramatic hahaha)</i></strong> when stalking a collegue <strong><i>(Molchat Doma - –°—É–¥–Ω–æ)</i></strong>, then youtube conspired (spied on me) and showed me a new song, then I met a Russian girl, then more music came into the picture, found out a German rapper I follow was actually Russian, discovered Poshlaya Molly, spotify made me listen to –ö–ò–°-–ö–ò–°, and finally . . . the Ukranian war.</p>,
            <p>All these events pushed me to learn Russian. I really got curious about that big chunk of the world full of countries that nobody likes to talk about, and to my surprised, it was totally  worth it.</p>,
            <p><strong>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt underestimate <i>the little things</i>, they can trigger big changes in your life.‚Äù</strong></p>,

            <p style={{ fontSize: '12px', margin: '0', marginTop: '-3em', color: '#900000' }}><i> So, there you have it, if you want a life reset, try learning a new language.</i></p>

            <p>I‚Äôm a person that has a very strong obsessive compultion, which has led me to limit the things I let myself be obsessed about.</p>,
            <p>The first time I did let myself fall hard into an obsession was in 2016, I had so much free time that I decided it didn‚Äôt mattered, luckily I found out that when I‚Äôm in the middle of my obsession, my brain doesn‚Äôt feel how tired I‚Äôm of hearing someone talking in a language I don‚Äôt understand, that‚Äôs how I learned how to watch movies in English without subtitles, it felt like my head was cut open and things just started to make sense.</p>,
            <p>I heard about <strong style={{ fontSize: '18px' }}>–∫–∏—Å-–∫–∏—Å</strong> almost a year ago, I was looking for new music on spotify when I stumbled into one of their tracks, it was amazing, in a weird way, I was not used to the sound they had, the combination was interesting, some kind of electronic sound, plus 2007 emo nostalgia. Months later, after getting into a Russian course, I was looking for a new interest, and rediscovered them by watching their music videos.</p>,
            <p>Whoever had the idea of the artistic concept of this band is a genius. The sound, the designs, the band name, the outfits, the way they approach concerts, the TaTu style of the interactions of the female bandmates, the subtle gopnik style, the music video shots, the colorization, the edition . . . just perfection.</p>,

            <p><i><strong>This year</strong></i> I fell into a routine were nothing out of the normal was happening, and that was driving me crazy, had a dozen existential crisis episodes, changed my mind like a thousand times, and made it up ten thousand times more.</p>,
            <p><i><strong>This year</strong></i> for the first time in my life, had an existential crisis about dying, about accepting my inevitable dead, and the dead of the people I love, about how stupid our existence can be, when all we did while alive was typing on a computer for 50 years while life was happening outside. Had a difficult time accepting that life in general has a sad ending, and there is a beauty in it, despite being raw and unfair.</p>,
            <p><i><strong>This year</strong></i>  I saw how all the flashy and beautiful places I used to visit no longer excite me, they lost their novelty and magic, maybe I got use to them, like we get use to anything in life, maybe I need a change, maybe what really excites me now is the <strong>‚Äòwhy?‚Äô</strong>, and not the <strong>‚Äòwhere?‚Äô</strong></p>,
            <p><i><strong>This year</strong></i>  was great, I also accomplished more than a couple of milestones in my life, I‚Äôm very proud of myself, I finally feel like I could give life advice to my 2019 self üòÇ.</p>

    //         <p>I'll basically blame exposure to music in general, because this started to happen more often to me when I was working on a Music House Store. . . I‚Äôve had never listened to so many instruments being played live so many times.</p>,
